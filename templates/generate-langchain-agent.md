3. Uses an LLM agent (GPT-3.5 or 4) to reason and invoke the tools

5. Emphasizes SDET, QA, or automation applications when appropriate

The script should fulfill this objective:

**Task:** {{user_goal}}

Include a printout at the end that clearly shows the agent's final output.

Make sure the code is valid, minimal, and uses the latest LangChain syntax as of July 2025.
