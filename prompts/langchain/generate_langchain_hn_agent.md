This script defines a LangChain tool using the `@tool` decorator for basic text processing tasks such as removing punctuation and converting to lowercase. It then uses an LLM agent (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to invoke this tool and process a given piece of text.

It's essential to note that such automation scripts are highly useful in SDET, QA, or other automation applications where there is a need to process large amounts of textual data, for example, cleaning up test logs or manipulating input data for testing.
