```python
import requests
import pytest

def test_api_behavior():
    # Substitute 'your_url' with the actual endpoint url and 'your_method' with POST, GET, etc.
    url = "your_url"
    method = "your_method"

    # Substitute 'your_payload' with your actual sample payload
    payload = "your_payload"

    if method == "GET":
        response = requests.get(url)
    elif method == "POST":
        response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
    # You can add more methods here like PUT, DELETE etc.

    # Substitute 200 with expected status code
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # You need to specify the keys you're expecting in the response. 
    # For example, if you're expecting keys 'id', 'name', and 'description', your test would look like this:
    
    expected_keys = ["id", "name", "description"]
    
    for key in expected_keys:
        assert key in response.json().keys()

# To run this test function use: pytest -k test_api_behavior
```
Please replace all placeholder values ('your_url', 'your_method', etc.) with your actual values.
