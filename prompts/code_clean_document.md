# 📌 Prompt Title: Upgrade and Explain LangChain Agent Script
# 🏷️ Tags: #langchain #sdet #qa #agentic #tool-calling #refactor
# 🔄 Version: 1.0
# ✍️ Author: Phil GeLinas
# 🧭 Use Case:
Take a functional but poorly explained LangChain agent script and upgrade it into a fully commented, professional-grade example.  
Target audience: QA engineers, SDETs, or automation devs learning how to build LLM-based agents that interact with real-world APIs.

---

## 🧠 Objective:
Enhance a raw LangChain agent script by adding:
- Clear, structured comments that explain the *what*, *why*, and *how*
- High-level reasoning about the importance of the approach
- Two well-formatted tables at the end of the file:
  - 🧠 Concept-to-Value table (e.g. "Tool Integration → Lets LLMs do real work")
  - 🧪 QA/SDET Use Cases table (e.g. "Live Doc Validation → Checks API doc freshness")

This should transform rough code into an educational, shareable reference example.

---

## 🛠️ Context or Input Format:
You will receive a valid but under-documented Python script that:
- Uses LangChain (v0.2+)
- Includes one or more tools (e.g., `@tool` decorators)
- Calls `create_tool_calling_agent` and runs a sample query

---

## 💬 Prompt:
You are a LangChain, LLM, and automation expert.

Take the following Python script that defines a LangChain agent and improve it for technical education and SDET-level use. Keep the code working, but enhance it with:

🔍 Clear inline comments explaining each step

💡 Strategic commentary about why each step matters (esp. for automation/QA)

📊 Two clean tables appended at the end:

One table explaining key concepts and their value

One table listing real-world QA/SDET use cases of this agent pattern

Use visual symbols (✅, 🧠, 🔐, etc.) where helpful.

Return everything as one clean Markdown block I can copy/paste directly — no explanations or extra text, just the code and tables.
